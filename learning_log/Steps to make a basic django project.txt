Basic setup of the project:
1. create a folder with the same name as the project
2. create virtual environment inside this folder
3. activate the virtual environment
4. install Django inside the virtual environment
5. start a django project with the same folder name as above
6. view if the project is set up by running the server

Start an App:
1. use "startapp" command to start a new app inside the project, 
   using a different name other than the project name is preferred.

2. define models in "models.py"
3. activate models in "settings.py", add your new App's name inside 
   the INSTALLED_APPS variable
4. tell Django to modify database for the new models: "makemigrations" then "migrate"
5. set up superuser with "createsuperuser"
6. register your model in the admin site by adding these line inside "admin.py", 
   - "from app_name.models import model_name"
   - "admin.site.register(model_name)"
